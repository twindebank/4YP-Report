    \subsection{Purpose}
    \label{subsec:pl-mozzpy-purp}
        \begin{sitemize}
            \item{have detailed the steps of the pipeline, this package provides a framework to now carry out research}
            \item{advantages of it are: easy to configure new experiments to run, easy to tweak any details within the pipeline from the config file, etc}
        \end{sitemize}
    
    \subsection{Structure}
    \label{subsec:pl-mozzpy-struc}
        \input{sections/pipeline/figs/dataflow.tex}
        
        Figure \ref{fig:pl-mozzpy-struc-dataflow} depicts how data is passed through the MozzPy package. Two classification pipelines are shown in this simplified example, in which they both use different sets of features and labels combined using different methods described in section \ref{subsec:pl-data-software}. The diagram is simplified for the purpose of clarity, the composition/inheritance relationship is shown in figure \ref{fig:pl-mozzpy-struc-inhercomp}.

        \twN{need to fix diagram, slight misalignment}
    
    \subsection{Usage}
    \label{subsec:pl-mozzpy-usage}
        \begin{sitemize}
            \item{show code snippet of how to run a exp and explain how will be detailed in this section}
            \item{explain how to configure a pipeline and how simple it is to run multiple experiments}
            \item{saving and laoding with file locking}
        \end{sitemize}
   
    \subsection{Cross-Validation and Parallel processing}
    \label{subsec:pl-mozzpy-xval}
        explain how each stage is wrapped in multiproc cross-val code omitted for clarity, tested in exp sec
    
    \subsection{Limitations}
    \label{subsec:pl-mozzpy-limit}
        \begin{sitemize}
            \item{current limitations: written in 2.7 not 3.5 - can be ported, wrote tailored to mozz problem so limited for use in other contexts to binary time series classification, functionality could be extended with some refactoring}
        \end{sitemize}
