\section{MozzPy Summary}
\label{sec:pl-mozzpy}

    \subsection{Purpose of Software}
    \label{subsec:pl-mozzpy-purp}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{have detailed the steps of the pipeline, this package provides a framework to now carry out research}
            \item{advantages of it are: easy to configure new experiments to run, easy to tweak any details within the pipeline from the config file, etc}
            \item{current limitations: written in 2.7 not 3.5 - can be ported, wrote tailored to mozz problem so limited for use in other contexts to binary time series classification, functionality could be extended with some refactoring}
        \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Class Structure}
    \label{subsec:pl-mozzpy-struc}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{tikz diagram of class structure}
            \item{explain why this way and the many variations of pipeline it can support}
        \end{itemize}
        
    \subsection{Configuration}
    \label{subsec:pl-mozzpy-conf}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{explain how to configure a pipeline and how simple it is to run multiple experiments}
        \end{itemize}
