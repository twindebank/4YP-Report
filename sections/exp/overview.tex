    \subsection{Design of a Pipeline that Maximises Detector Performance}
    \label{subsec:exp-overview-detect}
        \begin{sitemize}
            \item{resultant process that performs very well for this problem and with this data, also adaptable to different contexts ie phone detector vs sound trap detector}
            \item{greedy optimisation at each element of pipeline - only realisable solution compared to grid search}
            \item{split into three sections, pre-clf, post-clf and agg [remove greeedy part from intro on structure and expand here - could remove whole part all together]}
        \end{sitemize}
    
    \subsection{Novel Research in Asymmetrical Rejection and Aggregation}
    \label{subsec:exp-overview-novel}
        \begin{sitemize}
            \item{have used methods not currently used in other publications (need to triple check)}
            \item{has resulted in substantial performance improvements over that set by the baseline results of the unprocessed classifier outputs}
        \end{sitemize}
