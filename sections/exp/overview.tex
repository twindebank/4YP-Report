    \subsection{Design of a Pipeline that Maximises Detector Performance}
    \label{subsec:exp-overview-detect}
        In this section of a report, a detection model is produced through rigorous experimental procedures. The results are two models, tuned slightly differently, that perform very well in the task of mosquito detection. The section is divided into three sections. The first section focuses on cross-validated tuning of sets of parameters; once suitable classifiers are produced, then post-processing is trailed and finally the results are aggregated to produce two high-performance classifiers. Parameters are optimised in stages to ensure feasible compute-time.
    
    \subsection{Novel Research in Asymmetrical Rejection and Aggregation}
    \label{subsec:exp-overview-novel}
        Post-processing methods that are not currently present in other literature are tested in this section. Asymmetrical rejection is applied and new ways of visualising the rejection-space are trailed and used to tune two different classifiers. Results of this show substantial performance gains over symmetrical rejection.
