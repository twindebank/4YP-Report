\section{Tests on Other Species}
\label{sec:exp-other}
    To verify the discriminative ability of the final model, it is tested on the other recordings within the HumBug database. Ideally, the classifier should predict no mosquito over the whole \SI{6}{\hour} set of signals as they are a different species to the Culex q. the classifiers have been trained on. Results show that over 20 species, the true negative rate is $1.00$ and the false positive rate is $0.00$ indicating that there are a negligible number of positive predictions, providing evidence for the species-discrimination ability of the final detection model.
