\section{Summary}
\label{sec:exp-summary}
    In this section, three classifiers have been optimised and combined to effectively detect detect Culex \textit{q.} mosquito presence in an audio signal. Specifications are met with the exception of a higher rejection rate than desired. There are further improvements to be made throughout the pipeline at each stage. Examples include more advanced audio normalisation, more exploration of feature-space design in regards to parameter optimisation, an increased number of classifiers and more sophisticated aggregation. Here, a subset of available algorithms are tested in each phase of the pipeline, leading to an accurate, robust and generalisable detection pipeline.
