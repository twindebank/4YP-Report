\section{Detector Performance Specification}
\label{sec:exp-spec}
    restructure this and define cases 1,2,3,etc with differnet needs - say power isnt priprity at this stage, mostly about performance of detector, reference cases specified in intro
    \subsection{Smartphone Usage}
    \label{subsec:exp-spec-phone}
        \begin{sitemize}
            \item{annoyance if too sensitive}
            \item{want fairly high time res}
            \item{etc}
            \item{therefore specs are ...}
        \end{sitemize}
    
    \subsection{Light-Trap Sound Recording}
    \label{subsec:exp-spec-trap}
        \begin{sitemize}
            \item{purpose to get recordings of mozz when it comes close to trap}
            \item{therefore want sensitivity high as less cost of false positives}
            \item{time res doesnt have to be as high, can detect over time window of a minute then decide if theres a mosquito and record}
        \end{sitemize}
        
    \subsection{Solar Lamp Warning System}
    \label{subsec:exp-spec-lamp}
        \begin{sitemize}
            \item{cant be too many false positives as would be irritating for the user}
            \item{want to get lowest false negatives as possible}
            \item{etc. specs are ...}
        \end{sitemize}
