\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Acknowledgements}
Foremost, I express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Professor Stephen Roberts, who has enthusiastically motivated and guided me through every stage of the project with unequivocal expertise, making it a rewarding, informative and enjoyable experience.

I express my thanks to Ivan Kiskin for advising me through challenging problems and giving me the opportunity to contribute to a paper submitted to the ECML conference \cite{Kiskin}.

In addition, I thank Davide Zilli, whose regular input and guidance was indispensable, especially at the earlier, crucial, stages of the project. The rest of the HumBug team is also to thank; in particular, Marianne Sinka and her team who have collated the data and made this research possible.
