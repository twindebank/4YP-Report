Mosquitoes act as a vector for disease, prevention of this disease is where the motivation of this report lies. Over one million people every year die from mosquito-borne disease, hundreds of millions are put at risk. The ability to detect the presence of a mosquito within a sound recording is an invaluable tool for use in active warning systems, tracking swarm movements, and data-logging light traps, all which are valuable in understating and preventing the spread of these diseases. 

The following report establishes an extensive and detailed pipeline for mosquito detection in an audio signal as well as an accompanying software package to provide an environment for algorithm testing. Novel contributions are made within the general field of machine learning with the combined use of asymmetrical rejection and classifier result aggregation. The performance of the resultant pipeline is very good, with the advantage of being tunable for different applications.
