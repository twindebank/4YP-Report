   Annually, over one million people die from mosquito-borne disease, hundreds of millions are put at risk. The ability to detect the presence of a mosquito is an invaluable tool for use in active warning systems, tracking swarm movements, and data-logging. All of these applications are valuable in understanding and preventing the spread of these diseases. 
    
    The report establishes an extensive and detailed pipeline for detection of a particular mosquito species, \textit{Culex quinquefasciatus}, against general background noise and extends it to testing against recordings of other species. Alongside the building of a detection pipeline, a software package, `\textit{MozzPy}`, has been developed to provide an environment for algorithm testing, discussion of which augments the report throughout. This report details work towards an acoustic logging device, whereby detection is based upon the characteristic sound profile of mosquitoes.
    
    The database of recordings was provided by the HumBug project, a Google funded joint venture between Oxford University and Kew Gardens. Audio captured using inexpensive acoustic sensors, found within low-end smartphones, enables large volumes of diverse data to be collected and allows any resulting detectors to be run on a mobile platform, accessible to anyone with a smartphone.
    
    Novel contributions are made within the general field of machine learning with the combined use of asymmetrical rejection and classifier result aggregation. Resultant performance is very good, with accuracies exceeding the 90\% range subject to varying degrees of rejection, depending on the application.
